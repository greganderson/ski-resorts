# Ski Resorts

This is a simple repo, showing a way to represent a ski resort with dictionaries, then storing them as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file.
The `resort.py` file can be run as-is, as can the `ski_resorts.py`. `resort.py` builds a couple resorts, then stores them in files. `ski_resorts.py`
loads the list of resorts into a dictionary.

Soon I will have classes that represent the different parts of a resort, at which point I will deserialize the json into classes.
